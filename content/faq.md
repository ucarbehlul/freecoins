Q: How much does this pay?

A: This depends on the current decision and market rate.

Q: How can I donate to the faucet?

A:  You can donate to the faucet's TRK address.

Q: Hey! I never got my payment!

A: This could be for one of two reasons:

1. Just wait a while! Payouts are sent periodically, if it's been
more than a day, it might be...

2. We're out of money! The faucet might have run out of money.
In which case I will personally try to refill it, if that's not
possible, I apologize. You'll have to wait a week to try again.
You can check the main page and there is a ticker that shows the
current amount of money in the faucet.

Q: Why are you doing this? This seems like a scam.

A: We don't require an email address or phone number. How can this
be scam?
